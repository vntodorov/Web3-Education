This repository demonstrates the creation of a simple ERC20 token using Foundry for Ethereum smart contract development. It serves as a practice project to understand how ERC20 tokens work, and how to implement them with Foundry's fast and powerful framework.

# Features
* <b>ERC20 Token Implementation</b>: A basic ERC20 contract with standard functions like transfer, approve, and balanceOf.
  
* <b>Testing</b>: Basic unit tests to verify token functionality using Foundry's testing framework.
