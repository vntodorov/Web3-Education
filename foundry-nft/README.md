This project demonstrates the creation and management of NFTs (dynamic as well) on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to mint and own unique digital assets. The smart contract provides a simple implementation for minting, transferring, and verifying ownership of NFTs using ERC721 standards. Switching the state (mood) of the NFT is also included as a feature in the smart contract.
