This project demonstrates a basic Solidity smart contract for crowdfunding, built using the Foundry framework. Itâ€™s a simple practice project where users can fund a campaign by contributing Ether, and the contract allows for fund withdrawals if certain conditions are met.

# Features
* <b>Funding</b>: Users can contribute Ether to fund the campaign.

* <b>Withdrawal</b>: The contract owner can withdraw the funds after the campaign goal is met.

* <b>Basic Solidity Concepts</b>: Implements key Solidity concepts like payable functions, events, and modifier usage.
