# Web3-Education
All things I've done during my web3 education - Solidity + Foundry + Web3 Security. Topics include blockchain fundamentals, smart contract development, dApp creation, Web3 security, and more. I've also dabbled with creating NFTs and ERC-20 tokens, learning how they fit into the whole Web3 ecosystem. I've also explored and worked with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and gained hands-on experience with building and securing smart contracts for real-world applications.

<i>Ongoing Web3 learning process, featuring a collection of experiments, projects (practice and real-life examples) and notes that track my progress in mastering blockchain development and Web3 security concepts. More projects yet to come! Everything is subject to change! MIT license!</i>
